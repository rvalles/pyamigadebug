Enters execlib->Debug() in an infinite loop.

Great as a very lazy way to enter the kickstart builtin debugger and use amigaXfer.

This bootblock is particularly useful to write if you're using CrashEntry and don't have any bootable floppies. In this situation, use a blank disk and enable Format checkbox. Refer to the bootstrapping documentation.
