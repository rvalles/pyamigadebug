Enters execlib->Debug() in an infinite loop.

Great as a very lazy way to enter the debugger to then use amigaXfer.
This bootblock is particularly useful to write if you're using CrashEntry and don't have any bootable floppies.
In which case, you want a blank disk and Format enabled.

Refer to the bootstrapping documentation.
