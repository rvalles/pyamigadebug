Reference
- p83 @ Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual Exec (1986, ark:/13960/t90964j8b)
- There should be better/newer documentation for this somewhere, covering changes made later.
- Seen it named romwack, rom-wack, romwock.

Serial setup
- 9600bps 8N2, no flow control.
- RawIOInit() actually sets SERPER to 372, which is the NTSC value, regardless of PAL/NTSC.
- 9509.10 PAL, 9596.63 NTSC.
- With 1 stop bit, RomWack will sometimes miss incoming characters.

Entering debugger
- Call to exec.library's debug(0); (execbase -114).
- loadwb -debug then hidden menu -> debug.
- right mouse button on guru dialog (if Amiga doesn't reboot first).
- send DEL (0x7F) on serial, in power led blinking situation before guru reboot.

Notes
- Use framesize of 0 to alter write-only registers.
- A7/SSP can't be altered directly, but USP can (U).
- list will crash if not run with current at a task structure.
- Maybe it'd be a good idea to poke SERPER for faster serial.

Readline
bs deletes last char
^X deletes whole line

Movement
\r|<cr> dump current
n go to address 0xn
:n set frame size to 0xn
. advance one frame
, back one frame
<sp>|> advance 16bit word
<bs>|< back 16bit word
+n advance 0xn bytes
-n back 0xn bytes
[ follow current longword pointer
] back

Memory Operations
= modify 16bit word from current
alter modify several 16bit word from current
limit|^ set range upper bound to current address
find search 8/16/32bit pattern from current to upper bound
fill fills 8/16/32bit pattern from current to upper bound

Machine state
regs dumps registers
!An|!Dn|!U show (and alter) registers
go continues from current address
resume|^D continues from PC
^I|<tab> single instruction step

Breakpoint
set sets breakpoint at current
clear clears breakpoint at current
show shows breakpoints
reset clears all breakpoints

Other
user force-enables multitasking
ig|boot reboots
? shows help
list dumps process info from current (has to be a task structure)
